You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

Additionally, Ruff has some minor differences in its rule set, such as not including all of the 'opinionated' rules from flake8-bugbear. Ruff also has the capability to automatically fix its own lint violations, while Flake8 does not.
